## About Me

Hello!

I'm a third-year PhD student in Computational Math at Emory University, where I'm supported by a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and [Emory's Women in Natural Sciences Fellowship.](https://www.gs.emory.edu/admissions/finance_overview.html#:~:text=The%20Women%20in%20Natural%20Sciences,have%20demonstrated%20outstanding%20academic%20achievement.) I am fortunate to be advised by [Lars Ruthotto.](https://www.math.emory.edu/~lruthot/)

In summer 2024, I was in California at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) working with [Aydƒ±n Bulu√ß.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/)

In summer 2023 and January 2024, I was in Tokyo at the [High Performance AI Systems Research Team](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/research/labs/hpaisrt/) at [RIKEN Center for Computational Science](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/) working with [Mohamed Wahib.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3fmEegAAAAJ&hl=en)

Thank you for visiting my website!
