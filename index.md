## About Me

Hello!

I am a PhD student in Computational Math at Emory University, where I am supported by a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and [Emory's Women in Natural Sciences Fellowship.](https://www.gs.emory.edu/admissions/finance_overview.html#:~:text=The%20Women%20in%20Natural%20Sciences,have%20demonstrated%20outstanding%20academic%20achievement.)

In summer 2023, I'm in Tokyo interning at the [High Performance AI Systems Research Team](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/research/labs/hpaisrt/) at [RIKEN Center for Computational Science.](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/)

Thank you for visiting my website!
